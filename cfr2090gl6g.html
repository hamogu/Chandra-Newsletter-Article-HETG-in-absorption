<div>Chandra has two HRC detectors, one optimized for imaging (HRC-I) and one for spectroscopic observations (HRC-S). Similar to ACIS-S, the HRC-S is made of segments, that are mounted  to approximate the Rowland circle to keep the dispersed photons in the spectroscopic focus at all positions. Most LETG observations use the HRC-S. However, the background in the HRC-S is much higher than in the HRC-I, because the anti-coincidence shield of the HRC-S is not functional. In fact, the background alone would saturate the Chandra telemetry, and thus only a specific region of the signal is actually send to the ground. An LETG spectrum is just a line, so that works. However, an the two legs of the X spread so far apart that the outer parts of the spectrum might  get lost. So, we opt to use the HRC-I as the detector. The HRC-I is not as long as the HRC-S, but large enough to catch essentially all signal from the HETG. "<i>But</i>" I hear you say "<i>it is flat!"&nbsp;</i> and thus the spectrum is out of focus. True, I say, but not very much. The difference is small compared to the diameter of the Rowland circle (about 10 m) and the loss of resolving power is acceptable. We can adjust the focus position on Chandra, moving the detector up and down to determine exactly which wavelength region should be in focus. The figure shows MARX simulations for an HETG/HRC-I setup with different focus positions. For each focus setting, the resolving power peaks at a specific wavelength. However, the peaks of the resolving power distributions are so wide, that even with the flat HRC-I a large region of the spectrum will achieve a better resolving power than LETG observations.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
