<div>In this year's HETG update, I want to take the opportunity to delve deep into the relation between the HETG and absorption. There is some  bad news (possibly with a work-around), but also some good news: On the one hand, the increasing contamination on ACIS reduces the effective area at the soft end of the HETG range so much that observations of e.g. stellar O VII triplets no except for the very brightest stars and it seems that this trend will continue for the forseeable future (see article by L. David in this issue). In the first section of this article, I will show our efforts to open up a new mode for HETG users, that would pair the HETG with the HRC, to overcome this problem.&nbsp;</div><div>On the other hand, absorption in the far-away universe (as opposed to absorption on the CCD) is something that can help us learn about the structure of AGN and the properties of the  intergalactic or interstellar medium. So, as a positive counterpoint, I'll highlight some recent use of the HETG to study absorption in the universe in a productive way.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="312003" class="ltx_title_subsection">The bad news and a possible work-around</h2><div> The HETG is used almost exclusively with ACIS as a detector (there are only two exceptions to this rule in the entire history of Chandra, more about that later), and if you use ACIS, you want to use ACIS-S. As most readers of this newsletter surely know, ACIS-S consists of 6 CCDs arranged in a long array that catches both the positive and the negative diffraction orders of the HETG. The image on the detector has the form of an "X", because the HETG has two parts, the HEG (high-energy grating) and the MEG (medium energy grating), each of which is responsible for one of the legs of the "X"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2005PASP..117.1144C}</cite>. The CCDs of ACIS-S do not lie on a plane, instead they are tangential to the Rowland circle.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3>The gunk and the goo steal our soft photons</h3><div>The HETG disperses the photons, and the ACIS CCDs detect them. At least that's the plan. With increasing contamination on the ACIS chips, more and more of the soft photons are absorbed by the gunk and goo that sits on top of the CCDs. This is not so much an issue for the HEG, which is - surprise- most efficient for high-energy photons that pass through the absorbing layer, but more so for the MEG. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="149704" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="119180" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">What can we do?</h3><div>ACIS has been designed with the option of a bake-out, where the chips would be heated to remove all that gunk, but such a bake-out also poses a significant risk to the instrument (see, e.g., the project scientist's report in the 2017 newsletter). Absent a bake-out, we have basically three options: We stop using the HETGS for any science case that requires data longward of 15 Å , we just observe longer (in some cases, much much longer), or we try something new and set up our observations to use a detector other than ACIS.&nbsp;</div><div>When Chandra was launched, there was a clear expectation what grating and detector combinations would be useful together and looking at all observations carried out in 2017, the community still follows that pattern. Excluding calibration observations, there were 88 observations with HETG and all of them use ACIS-S as the detector of choice; in the same year there were 26 LETG observations and all of them used HRC-S as detector. There is a good reason why this is the standard choice - ACIS is efficient over the energy range where the HETG spectroscopy gives a good signal and the intrinsic energy resolution of the CCDs allows the user to separate the diffraction orders, making it much easier to analyze the extracted spectra than in the LETG/HRC-S combination where continuum from the third order can fall on the same detector position as the continuum from the first order and there is no way to tell which photon belongs where. However, the LETG is efficient to wavelengths much longer than what ACIS can detect, and thus the HRC is the detector of choice for LETG observations.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="654464" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Could we use HRC as a detector for HETG observations?</h3><div>Let's just say that again: "the LETG&nbsp;<i>is efficient to wavelengths much longer than what ACIS can detect, and thus the HRC is the detector of choice</i> ". With increasing contamination on ACIS, this starts to become true for HETG observations as well. If we want to detect long wavelength photons, ACIS just cannot deliver any longer; thus, using the HETG with the HRC is an option worth investigating. There is no such thing as a free lunch though, if we go from ACIS to HRC, we can no longer rely on the CCD energy resolution to perform order sorting - just as it is true for LETG/HRC observations. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="351053" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Motivation to test HETG/HRC</h3><div>If an observation aims specifically for diagnostics at relatively long wavelength (say the O VIII line at 18.97 Å, or the O VII triplet around 22 Å ), one might use the LETG instead of the HETG in the first place. However, we often do not need just one diagnostic in our spectra, we need to analyze all the signal that we can get. The HETG is ahead of the LETG in at least two areas: First, the HETG has a higher spectral resolving power than the LETG. If a science case requires the very best resolution we can get, then we have to use the HETG. Second, the HETG is much better at wavelengths shortward of 15 Å. If the science requires good signal in this region, again, we have no choice but use the HETG.</div><div></div><div>Let me give an example from my own research (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{2010AampA...519A..97G}</cite>): I work on the X-ray activity seen in classical T Tauri stars (CTTS). These are young, low-mass, pre-main sequence stars in the phase of planet formation. They are still surrounded by an accretion disk, and mass falls from this disk onto the stellar surface where it forms an accretion shock. The shock is hot enough to be seen in X-rays. To measure densities and temperatures in the shock, we need to observe the O VII triplet around 22 Å, as well as the Ne IX triplet around 13.5 Å. The latter is often contaminated by Fe lines; HETG resolution is required to resolve those lines. Because the spectrum is dominated by known emission lines, order sorting is less of a problem than in continuum dominated sources - since we know the wavelength of the line, we can easily see which lines are first-order lines and which ones are third-order lines. The CTTS TW Hya is the first science target scheduled for an HETG/HRC observation. (Ignoring the observation of GX 3+1, see discussion below.)</div><div></div><h3 data-label="285507" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">One more twist: HRC-I vs. HRC-S</h3><div></div>
