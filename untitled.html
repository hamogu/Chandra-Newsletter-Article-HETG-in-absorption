<div>In this year's HETG update, I want to take the opportunity to delve deep into HETG and absorption. There is some  bad news (possibly wit ha work-around), but also some good news: On the one hand, the increasing contamination on ACIS, absorbs more and more of the long-wavelength photons, which, unfortunately, reduces the effective area at the soft end of the HETG range so much that observations of e.g. stellar O VII triplets are now unfeasable except for the very brightest stars and all sings indicate that this trend will continue for the forseeable future (<b>reference to other newsletter article here</b>). In the first section of this article, I will show our efforts to open up a new mode for HETG users, that would pair the HETG with the HRC to overcome this problem.&nbsp;</div><div>On the other hand, absorption in the far-away universe (as opposed to absorption on the CCD) is something that can help us learn about the structure of AGN and the properties of the  intergalactic or interstellar medium. So, as a positive counterpoint, I'll highlight some recent use of the HETG to study absorption in the universe in a productive way.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="312003" class="ltx_title_subsection">The bad news and a possible work-around</h2><div> The HETG is use almost exclusively with ACIS as a detector (there are only two exception to this rule in the entire history of Chandra, more about that later), and if you use ACIS, you want to use ACIS-S. As most readers of this newsletter surely know, ACIS-S consists of 6 CCDs arranged in a long array that catches both the positive and the negative diffraction orders of the HETG. The image on the detector has the form of an "X", because the HETG has two parts, the HEG (high-energy grating) and the MEG (medium energy grating), each of which is responsible for one of the legs of the "X"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2005PASP..117.1144C}</cite>. What is less well know, but nevertheless important, is that the CCDs of ACIS-S do not lie on a plane, instead they are tangential to the Rowland circle.&nbsp;</div><div>The HETG dispersed the potons</div><div></div>
