Excluding calibration observations, there were 88 observations with HETG and all of them uses ACIS-S as the detector of choice; in the same year there where 26 LETG observations an all of them used HRC-S as detector. There is a good reason why this is the standard choice - ACIS is efficient over the energy range where the HETG spectroscopy gives a good signal and the intrinsic energy resolution of the CCD allows the user to separate the diffraction orders, making it much easier to analyze the extracted spectra than in the LETG/HRC-S combination where continuum from the third order sits at the same position as the continnum from the first order and there is no way to tell which photon goes hwere.</div><div>I am, of course, fully aware that the title of this section is somewhat provocative, yet the usage statistics in current Chandra observations show clearly that the community has made a choiExclus26 LETG/hrc-s&nbsp; 88 HETG-ACIS</div>
