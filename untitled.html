<div>In this year's HETG update, I want to take the opportunity to delve deep into the relation between the HETG and absorption. There is some  bad news (possibly with a work-around), but also some good news: On the one hand, the increasing contamination on ACIS reduces the effective area at the soft end of the HETG range so much that observations of e.g. stellar O VII triplets are now unfeasable except for the very brightest stars and it seems that this trend will continue for the forseeable future (<b>reference to other newsletter article here</b>). In the first section of this article, I will show our efforts to open up a new mode for HETG users, that would pair the HETG with the HRC, to overcome this problem.&nbsp;</div><div>On the other hand, absorption in the far-away universe (as opposed to absorption on the CCD) is something that can help us learn about the structure of AGN and the properties of the  intergalactic or interstellar medium. So, as a positive counterpoint, I'll highlight some recent use of the HETG to study absorption in the universe in a productive way.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="312003" class="ltx_title_subsection">The bad news and a possible work-around</h2><div> The HETG is used almost exclusively with ACIS as a detector (there are only two exceptions to this rule in the entire history of Chandra, more about that later), and if you use ACIS, you want to use ACIS-S. As most readers of this newsletter surely know, ACIS-S consists of 6 CCDs arranged in a long array that catches both the positive and the negative diffraction orders of the HETG. The image on the detector has the form of an "X", because the HETG has two parts, the HEG (high-energy grating) and the MEG (medium energy grating), each of which is responsible for one of the legs of the "X"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2005PASP..117.1144C}</cite>. The CCDs of ACIS-S do not lie on a plane, instead they are tangential to the Rowland circle.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3>The gunk and the goo steal our soft photons</h3><div>The HETG disperses the photons, and the ACIS CCDs detect them. At least that's the plan. With increasing contamination on the ACIS chips, more and more of the soft photons are absorbed by the gunk and goo that sits on top of the CCDs. This is not so much an issue for the HEG, which is - surprise- most efficient for high-energy photons that pass through the absorbing layer, but more so for the MEG. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="149704" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="119180" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">What can we do?</h3><div>ACIS has been designed with the option of a bake-out, where the chips would be heated to remove all that gunk, but such a bake-out also poses a significant risk to the instrument (see, e.g., the project scientist's report in the 2017 newsletter). Absent a bake-out, we have basically three options: We stop using the HETGS for any science case that requires data longward of 15 Å , we just observe longer (in some cases, much much longer), or we try something new and set up our observations to use a detector other than ACIS.&nbsp;</div><div>When Chandra was launched, there was a clear expectation what grating and detector combinations would be useful together and looking at all observations carried out in 2017, the community still follows that pattern. Excluding calibration observations, there were 88 observations with HETG and all of them use ACIS-S as the detector of choice; in the same year there were 26 LETG observations and all of them used HRC-S as detector. There is a good reason why this is the standard choice - ACIS is efficient over the energy range where the HETG spectroscopy gives a good signal and the intrinsic energy resolution of the CCDs allows the user to separate the diffraction orders, making it much easier to analyze the extracted spectra than in the LETG/HRC-S combination where continuum from the third order can fall on the same detector position as the continuum from the first order and there is no way to tell which photon belongs where. However, the LETG is efficient to wavelengths much longer than what ACIS can detect, and thus the HRC is the detector of choice for LETG observations.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="654464" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Could we use HRC as a detector for HETG observations?</h3><div>Let's just say that again: "the LETG&nbsp;<i>is efficient to wavelengths much longer than what ACIS can detect, and thus the HRC is the detector of choice</i> ". With increasing contamination on ACIS, this starts to become true for HETG observations as well. If we want to detect long wavelength photons, ACIS just cannot deliver any longer; thus, using the HETG with the HRC is an option worth investigating. There is no such thing as a free lunch though, if we go from ACIS to HRC, we can no longer rely on the CCD energy resolution to perform order sorting - just as it is true for LETG/HRC observations. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="351053" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Motivation to test HETG/HRC</h3><div>If an observation aims specifically for diagnostics at relatively long wavelength (say the O VIII line at 18.97 Å, or the O VII triplet around 22 Å ), one might use the LETG instead of the HETG in the first place. However, we often do not need just one diagnostic in our spectra, we need to analyze all the signal that we can get. The HETG is ahead of the LETG in at least two areas: First, the HETG has a higher spectral resolving power than the LETG. If a science case requires the very best resolution we can get, then we have to use the HETG. Second, the HETG is much better at wavelengths shortward of 15 Å. If the science requires good signal in this region, again, we have no choice but use the HETG.</div><div></div><div>Let me give an example from my own research: I work on the X-ray activity seen in classical T Tauri stars (CTTS). These are young, low-mass, pre-main sequence stars in the phase of planet formation. They are still surrounded by an accretion disk, and mass falls from this disk onto the stellar surface where it forms an accretion shock. The shock is hot enough to be seen in X-rays. To measure densities and temperatures in the shock, we need to observe the O VII triplet around 22 Å, as well as the Ne IX triplet around 13.5 Å. The latter is often contaminated by Fe lines; HETG resolution is required to resolve those lines. Because the spectrum is dominated by known emission lines, order sorting is less of a problem than in continuum dominated sources - since we know the wavelength of the line, we can easily see which lines are first-order lines and which ones are third-order lines. The CTTS TW Hya is the first science target scheduled for an HETG/HRC observation. (Ignoring the observation of GX 3+1, see discussion below.)</div><div></div><h3 data-label="285507" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">One more twist: HRC-I vs. HRC-S</h3><div>Chandra has two HRC detectors, one optimized for imaging (HRC-I) and one for spectroscopic observations (HRC-S). Similar to ACIS-S, the HRC-S is made of segments, that are mounted  to approximate the Rowland circle to keep the dispersed photons in the spectroscopic focus at all positions. Most LETG observations use the HRC-S. However, the background in the HRC-S is much higher than in the HRC-I, because the anti-coincidence shield of the HRC-S is not functional. In fact, the background alone would saturate the Chandra telemetry, and thus only a specific region of the signal is actually send to the ground. An LETG spectrum is just a line, so that works. However, an HETG spectrum has the shape on the X and the two legs of the X spread so far apart that the outer parts of the spectrum might  get lost. So, we opt to use the HRC-I as the detector. The HRC-I is not as long as the HRC-S, but large enough to catch essentially all signal from the HETG. I hear you say&nbsp;<i>it is flat</i> and thus the spectrum is out of focus. True, I say, but not very much. The difference is small compared to the diameter of the Rowland circle (about 10 m) and the loss of resolving power is acceptable. We can adjust the focus position on Chandra, moving the detector up and down to determine exactly which wavelength region should be in focus. The figure shows MARX simulations for an HETG/HRC-I simulation with different focus positions. For each focus setting, the resolving power peaks at a specific wavelength. However, the peaks of the resolving power distributions are so wide, that even with the flat HRC-I a large region of the spectrum will achieve a better resolving power than LETG observations.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="224631" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Data from HETG/HRC-I observations</h3><div>So far, there are two HETG/HRC-I observations in the archive. The first one is ObsID 13712 (target GX 3+1). The object is a very bright continuum source and the HETG was merely used to disperse some of the photons and reduce the count rate in zeroth order. The dispersed spectrum is visible on the detector (see figure), but of limited scientific use. The second observation is from Capella, an active star (ObsID 19837) and was taken specifically to test the HETG/HRC-I mode. Capella is regularly observed as a calibration source. The position of the emission lines in the spectrum are well known, although their flux level changes.</div><div></div><div>Å </div><div></div><h2 data-label="883382" class="ltx_title_subsection">The good news: What we can learn from absorption</h2><div>In this section, I just want to highlight two recent scientific results that are based on absorption line spectroscopy using HETG data. This is a technique that is actively used in several areas of astrophysics, and picking out any one or two results from the recent literature necessarily means that much other important work is not shown here. Both examples re-analyze archival HETG data for their studies, looking at aspects in the data that were not central to the original observation. The data archive of existing HETG observations is quite rich already and grows with every new observations cycle. These works show that there often is much that can still be learned even from data that has be analyzed before. As the HETG instrument team, we try to make it as easy as we can to look at archival data. That is why we maintain TGCat (<a href="http://www.tgcat.mit.edu">http://www.tgcat.mit.edu</a>), a web-archive of all Chandra grating data that offers quicklook images of all reduced datasets and download of science-ready data products.</div><div></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{2017RAA....17...95F}</cite> present a new study of the bright Seyfert I galaxy NGC 3783. This target has accumulated more than 1 Ms of exposure time with Chandra/HETG and a number of works have fitted the absorption lines seen in the spectrum to derive the properties of the warm absorbers seen in the spectrum - with sometimes inconsistent results. What is new about the work of&nbsp; Fu et al. (2017) is that they simultaneously fit X-ray data from Chandra/HETG data and UV data HST/COS data (both observations were taken within a few days of each other) using the same model in XSTAR. Their model provides a good fit to both the UV data and the X-ray data at the same time, using a total of five warm absorbers. Only two of these seem to be in pressure balance; two seem to be smaller clouds that have only recently been blown out from the torus. The authors estimate that total mass outflow to 0.2-4 solar masses per year.</div><div>The second example of HETG absorption spectroscopy that I want to highlight here looks at the circum-galactic medium (CGM) of our own Milky Way.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{2017ApJ...836..243G}</cite> analyze the absorption lines seen in a Chandra/HETG observation towards Mrk 509. This spectrum has been analyzed before&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014AampA...570A..73K}</cite> to understand the properties of the Mrk 509 itself, but in this new study Gupta et al. (2017) concentrate on redshift zero absorption lines and relate those to new blank sky observations with Suzaku and XMM-Newton that were taken very close to this sightline to characterize the emission measure of the CGM in this direction. They directly detect several absorption lines, notably from O VII and O VIII, indicating significant absorbing column density; the mass in the absorber might actually help to solve the missing baryon problem. The exact estimate of the mass depends on the assumed spatial distribution (density profile clumpiness) of the CGM and is debated in the literature, but in any case it is clear that HETGS absorption lines deliver crucial data to address this problem.</div>
