Excluding calibration observations, there were 88 observations with HETG and all of them uses ACIS-S as the detector of choice; in the same year there where 26 LETG observations an all of them used HRC-S as detector. There is a good reason why this is the standard choice - ACIS is efficient over the energy range where the HETG spectroscopy gives a good signal and the intrinsic energy resolution of the CCD allows the user to separate the diffraction orders, making it much eaiser to </div><div>I am, of course, fully aware that the title of this section is somewhat provocative, yet the usage statistics in current Chandra observations show clearly that the community has made a choiExclus26 LETG/hrc-s&nbsp; 88 HETG-ACIS</div>
