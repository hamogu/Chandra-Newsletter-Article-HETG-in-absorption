<h3 data-label="224631" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Data from HETG/HRC-I observations</h3><div>So far, there are two HETG/HRC-I observations in the archive. The first one is ObsID 13712 (target GX 3+1, Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{588290}</span>). The object is a very bright continuum source and the HETG was merely used to disperse some of the photons and reduce the count rate in zeroth order. The dispersed spectrum is visible on the detector, but of limited scientific use. The second observation is from Capella, an active star (ObsID 19837) and was taken specifically to test the HETG/HRC-I mode (Fig 2). Capella is regularly observed as a calibration source. The position of the emission lines in the spectrum are well known, although their flux level changes.</div>
