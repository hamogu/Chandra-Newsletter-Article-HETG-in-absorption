<h3 data-label="981289" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Does HETG/HRC-I work?</h3><div>The observation of Capella was successful. Data can be taken with the HETG and the HRC-I as a detector. However, more work, both in calibration and in CIAO, is needed before this mode can be used routinely. At the current time, it is only warrented for a few special cases where the LEG resolving power is insufficient, but emission lines in the range 15-25   Å are crucial. On the other hand, with increasing contamination there will be more and more cases where the HRC can offer a better overall performance ith the HETG than ACIS-S.</div><div> </div><h2 data-label="883382" class="ltx_title_subsection">The good news: What we can learn from absorption</h2><div>In this section, I want to highlight two recent scientific results that are based on absorption line spectroscopy using HETG data. Obviously, picking out just two results from the recent literature necessarily means that much other important work is not shown here. Both examples re-analyze archival HETG data for their studies, looking at aspects in the data that were not central to the original observation. The data archive of existing HETG observations is quite rich already and grows with every new  cycle. As the HETG instrument team, we try to make it as easy as we can to look at archival data. That is why we maintain TGCat (<a href="http://www.tgcat.mit.edu">http://www.tgcat.mit.edu</a>), a web-archive of all Chandra grating data that offers quicklook images of all reduced datasets and download of science-ready data products.</div><div></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{2017RAA....17...95F}</cite> present a new study of the bright Seyfert I galaxy NGC 3783. This target has accumulated more than 1 Ms of exposure time with Chandra/HETG and a number of works have fitted the absorption lines seen in the spectrum to derive the properties of the warm absorbers seen in the spectrum - with sometimes inconsistent results. What is new about the work of&nbsp; Fu et al. (2017) is that they simultaneously fit X-ray data from Chandra/HETG data and UV data from HST/COS (both observations were taken within a few days of each other) using the same model in XSTAR. Their model provides a good fit to both the UV and the X-ray data at the same time, using a total of five warm absorbers. Only two of these seem to be in pressure balance; two seem to be smaller clouds that have only recently been blown out from the torus. The authors estimate that total mass outflow to 0.2-4 solar masses per year.</div><div>The second example of HETG absorption spectroscopy that I want to highlight here looks at the circum-galactic medium (CGM) of our own Milky Way.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{2017ApJ...836..243G}</cite> analyze the absorption lines seen in a Chandra/HETG observation towards Mrk 509. This spectrum has been analyzed before&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014AampA...570A..73K}</cite> to understand the properties of the Mrk 509 itself, but in this new study Gupta et al. (2017) concentrate on redshift zero absorption lines and relate those to new blank sky observations with Suzaku and XMM-Newton that were taken very close to this sightline to characterize the emission measure of the CGM in this direction. They directly detect several absorption lines, notably from O VII and O VIII, and comparing this to the emission seen in XMM-Newton the can estimate the column density of the CGM; the mass in the absorber might actually help to solve the missing baryon problem. The exact estimate of the mass depends on the assumed spatial distribution (density profile, clumpiness) of the CGM and is debated in the literature, but in any case it is clear that HETG absorption lines deliver crucial data to address this problem.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="313874" class="ltx_title_subsection">Summary</h2><div>The HETG team is actively investigating observations with HETG/HRC-I. We hope that this combination can be useful for observers who want to use the HETG, but also require good signal between 15 and 25 Å. I presented some promising initial work, but I have to highlight, that, as of now, this is not an officially supported mode for general observers and that the current CIAO software will not process these observations out-of-the-box.</div>
