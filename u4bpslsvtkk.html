Excluding calibration observations, there were 88 observations with HETG and all of them uses ACIS-S as the detector of choice; in the same year there where 26 LETG observations an all of them used HRC-S as detector. There is a good reason why this is the standard choice - ACIS is efficient over the energy range where the HETG spectroscopy gives a good signal and the intrinsic energy resolution of the CCD allows the user to separate the diffraction orders, making it much easier to analyze the extracted spectra than in the LETG/HRC-S combination where continuum from the third order sits at the same position as the continuum from the first order and there is no way to tell which photon belongs where. However, the LETG is efficient to wavelengths much lower than what ACIS can detect, and thus the HRC is the detector of choice for LETG observations.</div><div></div><div>Ã… </div><div></div><h2 data-label="883382" class="ltx_title_subsection">The good news: What we can learn from absorption</h2><div>In this section, I just want to highlight two recent scientific results that are based on absorption line spectroscopy using HETG data.

This target has accumulated more than 1 Ms of exposure time with Chandra/HETG and a number of works have fitted the absorption lines seen in the spectrum to derive the properties of the warm absorbers seen in the spectrum - with sometimes inconsistent results. What is new about the work of&nbsp; Fu et al. (2017) is that they simultaneously fit X-ray data from Chandra/HETG data and UV data HST/COS data (both observations were taken within a few days of each other) using the same model in XSTAR. Their model provides a good fit to both the UV data and the X-ray data at the same time, using a total of five warm absorbers. Only two of these seem to be in pressure balance; two seem to be smaller clouds that have only recently been blown out from the torus. The authors estimate that total mass outflow to 0.2-4 solar masses per year.</div><div>The second example of HETG absorption spectroscopy that I want to highlight here looks at the circum-galactic medium (CGM) of our own Milky Way.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{2017ApJ...836..243G}</cite> analyze the absorption lines seen in a Chandra/HETG observation towards Mrk 509.
