<div>The initial processing of this data can be down with CIAO, but requires some non-standard settings; however, there is currently no way to calculate a proper ARF and RMF because the required data is not included in the CALDB. Thus, I will refrain from fitting a full physical model with thermal emission components at this point. The spectrum clearly shows that plenty of signal is detected in this combination. I mean, where else should the photons go? Instead, I just select a few emission lines that are not significantly confused. The wings of the HETG line spread function (LSF) are complex, but the core is dominated&nbsp; by a simple Gaussian (<a href="http://space.mit.edu/CXC/LSF/LSF_0002/LSF_build2.html">http://space.mit.edu/CXC/LSF/LSF_0002/LSF_build2.html</a>). Fitting a model of a Gaussian and a constant to each of these emission lines, we can determine the resolving power and compare it to Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{324316}</span>. This comparison is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{552764}</span>. As expected for a grating, the resolving power increaes with wavelength and values close to the predicted number are reached in the observations</div><div></div>
